Blocking Gravity 
===============

Blocking Gravity is a simple arcade style game made for my personal high school senior project in 2012. 

You play as an unassuming square block that is perpetually falling towards the bottom of the screen. Rising from the bottom of the screen are rows of rectangular blocks that float upward; should you land on them the blocks begin to push you upward toward the top of the screen. If your block hits the top of the screen, you lose. 
To prevent this, the player moves left or right across the screen, falling through the gaps in the rows of rectangular blocks. The games in theory does not end, but the amount of blocks that appear from the bottom increases as time passes.

This game was made using Visual Studio 2012 and XNA Game Studio 4.0, written in C# and XNA. It was my first attempt at a full scale deployment of an actual product outside of code snippets and class projects. Thus, some of the code is not of the highest quality. I intend to revisit this project in the future with a complete rewrite as it does mean a lot to myself, possibly using a game engine such as Unity. 

Special thanks to Omer M. Soysal for being my advisor and providing assistance during the project.
